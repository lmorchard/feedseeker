# feedseeker

This is an experimental feed reader built as a browser extension.

As you browse, it attempts to discover feeds and automatically start following them. You can ignore the ones that aren't interesting.

## TODO

* dark mode
* record last update time for each feed
* manual feed follow
* feed management panel
* OPML export of followed feeds
* configurable timespan for display
* lazy-load feed items on scroll so we don't load everything at once
* group items by feed, sort feeds by last update time
* algorithmic priority sort (optional)
  * infrequently-updated feeds should float higher
  * accept manual likes as signal to boost a feed
